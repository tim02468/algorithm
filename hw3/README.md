# Resource Allocation Problem
## Rule
1. Given m resources and n projects, a profit(i, j) will be obtained if j, 𝟎 ≤ 𝒋 ≤ 𝒎, resources are allocated to project i.
2. Find an allocation of resources to maximize the total profit.
3. Please use dynamic programming approach to design an algorithm and implement the program to solve the resource allocation problem.
